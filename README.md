# bounceFilter
This project simulates switch debounce filtering using a capacitor in Tinkercad. The code reads analog values from a capacitor-resistor circuit, prints voltage readings across the capacitor (VC) and resistor (VR) over time, demonstrating the voltage charging and discharging process. Results are displayed in the Serial Monitor.
